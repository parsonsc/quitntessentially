								DISPLAY ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING
								<br>
								<br>
								Our Sites use a unique tracking code to support Google Display Advertising enabling Google Analytics to collect traffic data by using our cookies. This is in addition to the data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation allowing the Remarketing feature based on Display Advertising from Google. It is with this feature that we use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online adhering to
								<br>
								the
								<a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=143465">Google Adwords Remarketing Policy</a> and its <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2549062/">sensitive category restrictions</a>.<br>
								<br>
								We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimise, and serve advertisements based on your past visits to our Sites for 30 days.
								<br>
								<br>
								OPT-OUT OR CHANGE PREFERENCES OF DISPLAY ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING

								<br>
								COOKIES
								<br>
								<br>
								Our Sites use cookies to ensure that you get the most out of each Site and so that we can tailor our services to you. Cookies are small amounts of information in the form of text files which we store on your computer. Cookies allow us to monitor website traffic, improve the Sites’ usability and to personalise the content of the Sites for you.
								<br>
								<br>
								We may use an analytics service provider for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to the Sites may be used to create reports about the use of the Sites and the analytics service provider will store this information.
								<br>
								<br>
								In addition, advertisers whose advertisements appear on the Sites, and other third parties who use our technology to store or collect data, may use and place cookies on your computer and we have no control over this. Please consult the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies of such third parties to find out how they collect and use your personal data and to establish whether they use cookies and what they may use them for.
								<br>
								<br>
								A few of the methods that may be used to store or access information already stored on your computer are as follows (although note that subsequent technology and methods may be developed):
								<br>
								<br>
								•  Cookies.  A cookie is a text file placed on a device when a user visits a website. Cookies can be temporary (e.g. session) or permanent (e.g. persistent). They can also be first party (e.g. placed by us) or third party (e.g. placed by a third party advertiser or ad server).
								<br>
								<br>
								•  Flash Cookies. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on your device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. This can operate across all your browsers
								<br>
								<br>
								•  HTML5. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage and do not require a plug-in.
								<br>
								<br>
								•  ETag or entity tag.  An opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL that acts as a form of device identifier.
								<br>
								<br>
								We use the information collection technologies set out in the table below for the following purposes:

								We may also use your information to notify you of our services and our exciting new offers if you have either requested marketing communications from us, or consented to receive marketing communications when you registered for one of our services. If you do not want to receive such marketing communications, please tick the appropriate box on the relevant Site’s registration page. You may opt out of receiving such marketing communications at any time by following the instructions below.
								<br>
								<br>
								We may permit selected third party partners or affiliates of ours to provide you with information about their products and services which may be of interest to you, as long as you have consented to receive marketing communications from our selected third parties for such purposes.
								<br>
								<br>
								You may opt out from receiving marketing communications at any time by notifying us in writing, contacting us at
								<a href="mailto:privacypromise@quintessentially.com">privacypromise@quintessentially.com</a> or, alternatively, by following the procedure to ‘unsubscribe’ that is specified in any marketing email that you receive. <br>
								<br>
								THIRD PARTY SITES
								<br>
								<br>
								Our Sites may contain links to websites that are operated by third parties. We do not control and accept no liability or responsibility for those websites and this privacy promise does not apply to those websites. Please consult the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third party websites to find out how they collect and use your personal data.
								<br>
								<br>
								Advertisements contained on our Sites operate as links to the advertiser’s website and as such any information they collect by virtue of your clicking on that link will be collected and used by the relevant advertiser in accordance with the privacy policy of that advertiser.
								<br>
								<br>
								WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
								<br>
								<br>
								The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("
								<strong>EEA</strong>"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers, suppliers, franchisees or affiliates. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy promise.<br>
								<br>
								HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
								<br>
								<br>
								All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or servers hosted by third party service providers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL/TLS technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
								<br>
								<br>
								Once we have received your information, appropriate security measures will be adopted to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the security of data you send over the internet and that you send your information at your own risk.
								<br>
								<br>
								Your information will only be held for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires or permits.
								<br>
								<br>
								DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
								<br>
								<br>
								We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group of companies (which includes any of our subsidiaries).
								<br>
								<br>
								We may also disclose your personal information: (i) to our affiliates, franchisees, suppliers, delivery companies, customers with whom we have contracted to provide services to you and other third parties to whom disclosure is necessary to enable us to process your orders and provide you with any service to which you have subscribed via the Site; (ii) where required to do so by law or court order; (iii) upon the sale of the business (in which case personal data of our customers will be one of the transferred assets); and (iv) to any person to whom disclosure is necessary to enable us to enforce our rights under this privacy promise or under any of our applicable Terms and Conditions.
								<br>
								<br>
								We may provide third parties with anonymised reports on our customers’ preferences, interests and buying habits. We may provide our trusted service providers with anonymous information about our customers in order for them to compile these reports on our behalf. These reports will not identify you in any way.
								<br>
								<br>
								Other than as expressly set out in this privacy promise or as otherwise required or permitted by law, we will not share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent.
								<br>
								<br>
								ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION
								<br>
								<br>
								You may at any time request access to your personal data by contacting us using the contact details set out below. We reserve the right to ask you for proof of your identity and to charge you a fee of ten pounds sterling (£10) to meet our costs in granting any data access request you make.
								<br>
								<br>
